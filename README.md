# OpenModelica_Microgrids
  
OpenModelica_Microgrids is a free package that is developed with the Modelica language from the [Modelica Association](https://www.Modelica.org).

It was designed in the scope of the [OpenModelica Microgrid Gym (OMG)](https://github.com/upb-lea/openmodelica-microgrid-gym) project. 

This Library can be used either to create microgrids for the OMG toolbox, or to create custom microgrids and test control structures for them.

## Example

A small network is shown below:

Controller designs and their parametrization can be tested:

## Usage
OpenModelica_Microgrids is designed and tested with OpenModelica and should load correctly if the [Modelica Standard Library](https://github.com/modelica/Modelica) is available.
